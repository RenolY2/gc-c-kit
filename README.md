# gc-c-kit
A toolkit for compiling C code using devkitppc and injecting it into a Gamecube Executable (dol). 
It has been written in such a way that it can be adapted to different GC games.
This branch has been created specifically for the US version of MKDD.

# How to use it 
You need Python 3 and devkitppc installed. Check the paths at the top of devkit_tools.py as to
where devkitppc needs to exist.
